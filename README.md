# Englishest

In a nutshell, with this gem enabled you can now spell `<=>` as `trichotomize`,
and so on.

This gem aims to provides alternative ways to utter Ruby code, simply defining
synonyms for miscellaneous terms, especially offering full word counterpart
to ideograms/logograms such as the so called *spaceship operator*.

The name of the gem is of course a pun: a library which provides ability
to utter coder which is closer to a voiceable English obviously ought to do it
so through an obvious transgression of this language usual rules on superlatives.
